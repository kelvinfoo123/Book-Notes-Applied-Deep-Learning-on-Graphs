# Book-Notes-Applied-Deep-Learning-on-Graphs
This repository combines notes from two books: 
1. Applied Deep Learning on Graphs (2024)
2. Hands on Graph Neural Network using Python (2023)

The books serve as a reference to a Stanford AI course that I am self-studying: CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs.
